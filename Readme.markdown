# open_auth2 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sent-hil/open_auth2.png?branch=master)][travis]

[travis]: http://travis-ci.org/sent-hil/open_auth2

OpenAuth2 is a thin OAuth2 wrapper written on top of Faraday in Ruby. The goal is a simple, well documented, easy to use interface for all your OAuth2 needs.

* This software is alpha, you're either very brave or very foolish to use this in production of rockets or anything else.

## Config

To begin, let's setup the configuration. Here we're assuming connection to Facebook api. OpenAuth2 supports Google and Facebook out of the box (more to come soon). Other sites can be configured manually.

```ruby
require 'open_auth2'

# get this info by signing your app at developers.facebook.com
client_id     = 'enter in your own value'
client_secret = 'enter in your own value'
redirect_uri  = 'enter in your own value'

config = OpenAuth2::Config.new do |c|
  # indicate what kind of provider you want to use
  # Accepts: OpenAuth2::Provider::Default, OpenAuth2::Provider::Facebook, OpenAuth2::Provider::Google

  c.provider       = OpenAuth2::Provider::Facebook

  c.client_id      = client_id
  c.client_secret  = client_secret
  c.redirect_uri   = redirect_uri
  c.scope          = ['publish_stream']
end
```

## Client

Next, initialize a `client` object, which we'll use to make requests and pass in the `config` object we created earlier.

```ruby
client = OpenAuth2::Client.new(config)
```

## Authenticate Url

To start the OAuth2 exotic dance, you'll need to obtain a 'code' from the server, which you can then use to request an 'access_token'. Redirect the user/yourself to this url to obtain that 'code'.

```ruby
token.build_code_url
```

`build_code_url` takes optional params hash, which will be bundled into the url.

```ruby
token.build_code_url(:scope => 'publish_stream')
```

## Access token

Access token is used to sign the request so the server can identify the client sending the request. If you already have an access token, add it to the client with a block.

```ruby
client.access_token  = 'enter in your value'
client.refresh_token = 'enter in your value'
```

## GET Access Token

If you don't have an access token, we'll need to ask the server for it.

`token#configure` is similar to `client#connection`.

```ruby
token = OpenAuth2::Token.new(config)

# asks Facebook for access_token
token.get

# the following methods are now available
token.access_token
token.refresh_token
token.token_expires_at
token.token_expired?
token.token_arrived_at
```

## GET Refresh Token

```ruby
# tells Facebook api to extend the expiration of the access_token
token.refresh
```

## GET request

To make an api call, simply call `get` with your path.

```ruby
client.get('/cocacola')
```

`get` accepts a Hash as second argument, which can be used to pass in additional parameters.

```ruby
client.get('/cocacola', :limit => 1)
```

## Plugins

Since various OAuth2 providers differ in their implementation, OpenAuth2 provides a simple plugin system to accomodate the differences, rather than 'one shoe fits all' approach. Facebook and Google plugins are builtin, but it is trivial to add new ones.

There are only two requirements:

  1. Can contain #options method
  1. Can contain #before_client_post method
  1. Can contain #after_token_post method

To use the plugin, call `Config#provider=` with name of the provider.

### Plugin Example

```ruby
module OpenAuth2
  module Provider
    class ThirdApi
      options :response_type => 'code',
        :access_token_grant_name => 'authorization_code',
        :refresh_token_grant_name => 'refresh_token',
        :refresh_token_name => :refresh_token,
        :scope => []

      before_client_post do |params|
        params[:url] += '?extra_params'
      end

      after_token_post do |response_body, config|
        token = response_body.gsub('access_token=', '')
        config.access_token = token
      end
    end
  end
end
```
